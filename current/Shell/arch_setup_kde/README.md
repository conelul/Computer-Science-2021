# Work in Progress

This is intended to be setup script for Arch Linux. This script is intended to be used **just** by me, since it doesn't prompt for user input and everything is predetermined (most Arch users will probably do something like this on install though).

## Installs

This script will install:

```shell
Firefox
Discord
Paru
Dracula Theme
```

## Configuration

**Firefox is configured with two profiles:**

**Normal:** A bunch of privacy-focused extensions, also includes Arkenfox's [user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) (MIT License)

**Minimal:** Ad blocking and some fingerprinting protection

## Theming

My goal is for this script to automatically install the latest version of the Dracula theme for all relevant apps and the DE.
