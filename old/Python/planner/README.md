## Storage

The planner information (tasks, dates, and notes) is stored as a pickled object (list) in the same directory as the .py file.

## Newer Version

The newer version of the planner requires Python3.10+, as it requires match case statements.

## "Legacy" Version

The legacy version uses if statements instead and will work with Python3 (Requires PySimpleGUI).

## Notes

This planner has a few bugs, but works pretty well.
